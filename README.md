# Info
Packet Client is an MCBE Utility mod made by: Packet, Deq and Founder

The reason for PacketV2 not being released and Packet Client being discontinued was due to a faggot named Yaami, (I also lost motivation to keep Packet Client going a long time ago but this just added onto it) yaami went to go edate a dog (disepi, zephyr dev thats braindead) because they are 18 years old and still living with their mom coding block game cheats LMAO they also skidded deqs math just so they could have decent looking visuals (because they cant code it themselves) and then made "Netherite Client (LOL)" out of skidded code and refused to remove it and say im in the wrong

Packet Client is a fork of the Horion Client
