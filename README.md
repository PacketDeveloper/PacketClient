# Info
Packet Client is an MCBE Utility mod made by: Packet, Deq and Founder

The reason for PacketV2 not being released and Packet Client being discontinued was due to a faggot named Yaami, they went to go edate a dog because they are 18 years old and still living with their mom coding block game cheats (I also lost motivation to keep Packet Client going a long time ago but this just added onto it)

Packet Client is a fork of the Horion Client
